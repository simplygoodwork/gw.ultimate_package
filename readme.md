# The Ultimate Package
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/erskinedesign/ed.ultimate_package.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/erskinedesign/ed.ultimate_package)

The Ultimate Package is [Erskine Design][]'s framework for rapidly developing
the front-end of our projects and is under constant development and improvement
by the team at Erskine Design, who use it daily.

Please refer to the wiki for [Erskine's front-end coding standards][wiki]

## Getting started
The package is a barebones framework to help you rapidly develop your projects.
Create templates using the [Twig template engine][] in `/templates` as you need
them and use `/templates/elements.html` to check your styles.

If you run into any problems, read through the [FAQs][faqs] and if that doesn't help, then please [raise an issue][issues].

The app will render your template directly from the url, so if you go to
`/my/page.html` it will render the template in `/templates/my/page.html`.

You can use `screen-prototype.scss` for prototyping and `screen.scss` for production work.

## Requirements and setup
* [Node][] >= v0.10.0
* [Grunt][] >= 0.4.0
* [Composer][]
 
1. Install [Node][] and NPM
1. Install grunt cli `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Install [Composer][] locally with `curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php` or if you're on OS X you should probably use brew.

### Installing the Ultimate Package
1. Clone the repository, `git clone git://github.com/erskinedesign/ed.ultimate_package.git`
1. Update the submodules `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1. Install the PHP requirements `php composer.phar install`
1. Install grunt packages `npm install` the packages are defined in `packages.json` if you're nosy
1. Compile the CoffeeScript and Sass and run the JS unit tests `grunt`
1. Point your web server to the `/public` folder

## Watching for changes and compiling CoffeeScript / Sass
Grunt watch is a required package which allows you to watch for changes to your Sass and CoffeeScript.
This is useful for development, because as you save your files, Grunt will recompile them for you.

## Not designed for production!
This codebase is designed solely for development usage, we __strongly__
advise you do not use it in production. The routing is as basic as
possible, and thus has little protection built in.
